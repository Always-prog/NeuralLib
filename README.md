# NeuralLib
this is small lib for neural networks in Python3.7.
First lib is lib or Leaky ReLu activation, 
socend lib is is or Sigmoid activation,
this libs is 5 leyers.
To use this libs paste libs near to your python file.
to import ReLu lib write: from pynetrelu import *
to import Sigmoid lib write: from pynetsigmoid import *
To created new neural network write this: 
<your name on request> = Network5([n,n,n,n,n])
to treaning your network write:
<your network>.trening(inputs,must,speed lerning)
to get out network write:
out = <your network>.status(leyer number)# 1,2,3,4 or 5.
